# NY CHASE
## What is this project about
A simple path calculating tool for the game NY Chase. Given the starting square and actions taken by the antagonist - Mr. X - it returns the possible squares where they might have landed!

## How to use it
Make sure you have all the libraries in place, and then just run it on the command line.
